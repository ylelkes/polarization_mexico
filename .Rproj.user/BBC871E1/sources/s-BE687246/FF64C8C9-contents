## Three levels of polarization


```{r,results='asis',echo=F,message=F,warning=FALSE}

library(DiagrammeR)
m <- grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval, color = grey, style = filled]

---
## Outline of the talk
1. Introduce each level of polarization
  a. Elite polarization, Mass polarization, Meso-level polarization
2. Discuss ways in which they have been measured
3. Discuss trends
4. Leave with questions that might be interesting for people interested in complex systems

## Elite polarization
* We tend to think of it in terms of ideology: A candidate, a parties, position on one or more dimensions (generally left-right)

--
* Roll call votes: McCarty, N., Poole, K. T., & Rosenthal, H. (2016). Polarized America: The dance of ideology and unequal riches. mit Press.

--
* Campaign donation data: Bonica, A. (2014). Mapping the ideological marketplace. American Journal of Political Science, 58(2), 367-386.

--
* Use some scaling procedure, like Item Response Theory, Singular value decomposition, or what not, to locate actors on a latent dimension

--
* Need to assume that votes, who you get money from, are indicators of ideology 

---
## Researchers tend to think ideology can fall on multiple dimensions:
1. An economic/redistribution dimensions

--
2. Cultural distribution

--
3. Other dimensions have been suggested.

--
4. However, among political elites, a one-dimensional model can correctly classify ~84 percent of votes, a two-dimensional model correctly classifies ~86 percent or so (McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal)

## Has there been an increase in ideological divergence?
1. Data from the American National Election Study, 1982-2020
2. Some people think the government should provide fewer services, even in areas such as health and education, in order to reduce spending. Other people feel that it is important for the government to provide many more services even if it means an increase in spending. And of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4,5, or 6. Where would you place yourself on this scale?

## Another example
Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every possible effort to improve the social and economic position of blacks and other minority groups. Others feel that the government should not make any special effort to help minorities because they should help themselve. Others feel that the government should not make any special effort to help blacks because they should help themselves. Where would you place yourself on this scale? (1=Government should help minority groups/blacks; 7=Minority groups/ blacks should help themselves)

## Concluding thoughts
1. We have lots of trends, some piecemeal explanations (e.g., the internet, rise in social media, etc) but few holistic models that consider the three levels of polarization
2. We need a better understanding of mechanisms that tie together levels and types of polarization
3. When studying polarization, make sure you clearly define the level and type of polarization.
